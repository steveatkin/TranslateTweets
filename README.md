To get started with using Watson Machine and Language Identification services you need to fork this project
and change the Twitter credentials in the twitter4j.properties file to your own credentials. 

Once you have this project up and running with the Liberty for Java runtime and the Watson Machine and
Language Identification Services bound to the appliaction you can go ahead and enter a topic to 
search on Twitter. The application will then display the Tweets translated into the language you selected.
